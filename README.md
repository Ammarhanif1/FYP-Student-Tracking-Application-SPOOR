# Final Year Project

Student Tracking Application-SPOOR

## Purpose of the Project

Spoor is a student tracker application that will allow the parents and teachers to maintain track of where students are during university hours. This way, parents can worry less about their children and know their whereabouts.
It will further allow the teachers to send attendance notifications to the parents once their child enters the university. Studentâ€™s whole schedule will be visible to the parents and teachers including upcoming exam schedule, so that everyone is up to date. Our project will further introduce separate panels for parents and teachers. It will also consist of an emergency alert feature; a real-time emergency notification system will use phone calls or text messages for emergency communications.

## Overview of the Project

SPOOR is created using the Flutter framework integrated with the Dart programming language. Using Google's open-source Flutter framework developers create impressive, natively built, cross- platform apps from a single codebase. Flutter allows us to create, test, and release convenient desktop, online, mobile, and embedded applications. Flutter code compiles JavaScript as well as ARM or Intel machine code for rapid performance on any platform. SPOOR is made to enable effective tracking of your child. It can be used by teachers and parents and can be managed within the IOS/Android apps. The app is designed with a clean interface and accessibility in mind that would appeal to any digital native user or new student. Our app will use Firebase Database for securely saving user data.
A collection of Google APIS is used in the application. The Scaffold serves as a MaterialApp's top-level container. It uses the fundamental framework for the Material Design visual layout.
